  {
    question: "1. All the following statements are true with regard to enzymes EXCEPT:",
    answers: {
      a: "Enzymes lower activation energy.",
      b: "They alter the equilibrium of the reaction.",
      c: "They accelerate the chemical reaction.",
      d: "Most of the enzymes are proteins in nature."
    },
    correctAnswer: "b",
    explanation:
      "Enzymes speed up reactions by lowering the activation energy required, but they do not change the equilibrium of the reaction."
  },
  {
    question: "2. In competitive inhibition:",
    answers: {
      a: "Inhibitor has structural similarity to the substrate.",
      b: "Km is decreased.",
      c: "Vmax is decreased.",
      d: "Reaction rate is independent of substrate concentration."
    },
    correctAnswer: "a",
    explanation:
      "In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor resembles the substrate and competes for the enzyme’s active site."
  },
  {
    question: "3. What type of enzyme inhibitor would have the following effects: Vmax unchanged, Km increased?",
    answers: {
      a: "Competitive reversible inhibition",
      b: "Allosteric inhibition",
      c: "Irreversible inhibition",
      d: "Non-competitive inhibition"
    },
    correctAnswer: "a",
    explanation:
      "A competitive reversible inhibitor increases Km but leaves Vmax unchanged, because increasing substrate concentration can overcome inhibition."
  },
  {
    question: "4. Enzymes, which are produced in inactive form in the living cells, are called:",
    answers: {
      a: "Papain",
      b: "Lysozymes",
      c: "Apoenzymes",
      d: "Proenzymes"
    },
    correctAnswer: "d",
    explanation:
      "Proenzymes (zymogens) are inactive precursors that are activated when needed, often by cleavage of specific peptide bonds."
  },
  {
    question: "5. The non-protein part of an enzyme is called:",
    answers: {
      a: "Apoenzyme",
      b: "Holoenzyme",
      c: "Allosteric enzyme",
      d: "Isoenzyme",
      e: "Coenzyme"
    },
    correctAnswer: "e",
    explanation:
      "Coenzymes are organic, non-protein components (often derived from vitamins) that assist enzymes during catalysis."
  },
  {
    question: "6. These enzymes have different structures but the same catalytic function. They are called:",
    answers: {
      a: "Allosteric enzymes",
      b: "Isozymes",
      c: "Proenzymes",
      d: "Zymogens"
    },
    correctAnswer: "b",
    explanation:
      "Isoenzymes (isozymes) are multiple molecular forms of the same enzyme that catalyze the same reaction but differ in structure or kinetics."
  },
  {
    question: "7. Allosteric inhibition of an enzyme involves which of the following?",
    answers: {
      a: "Binding of an inhibitor to a site other than the substrate binding site.",
      b: "Binding of an inhibitor competitively to the substrate binding site.",
      c: "Binding of an inhibitor noncompetitively to the substrate binding site.",
      d: "Allosteric inhibitors increase the affinity of the enzyme to its substrate."
    },
    correctAnswer: "a",
    explanation:
      "Allosteric inhibitors bind to a regulatory site distinct from the active site, causing conformational changes that reduce enzyme activity."
  },
  {
    question: "8. When the velocity of enzyme activity is plotted against substrate concentration, which of the following is obtained?",
    answers: {
      a: "A hyperbolic curve",
      b: "A parabola",
      c: "A straight line with a positive slope",
      d: "A straight line with a negative slope"
    },
    correctAnswer: "a",
    explanation:
      "A hyperbolic curve is obtained according to the Michaelis–Menten model, showing saturation kinetics as substrate concentration increases."
  },
  {
    question: "9. Michaelis constant (Km) of an enzyme is:",
    answers: {
      a: "The substrate concentration which gives maximal velocity.",
      b: "The substrate concentration which gives ½ the maximal velocity.",
      c: "Half the substrate concentration which gives maximal velocity.",
      d: "The enzyme concentration which gives maximal velocity."
    },
    correctAnswer: "b",
    explanation:
      "Km is the substrate concentration at which the enzyme operates at half its maximal velocity (Vmax/2). It reflects substrate affinity."
  },
  {
    question: "10. Which of the following statements is true of enzyme catalysts?",
    answers: {
      a: "To be effective they must be present at the same concentration as their substrate.",
      b: "They can increase the equilibrium constant for a given reaction.",
      c: "They lower the activation energy for conversion of substrate to product.",
      d: "Their catalytic activity is independent of pH."
    },
    correctAnswer: "c",
    explanation:
      "Enzymes catalyze reactions by providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy, increasing reaction speed without changing equilibrium."
