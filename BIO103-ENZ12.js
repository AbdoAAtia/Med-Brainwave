    question: "29. Regarding competitive inhibition:",
    answers: {
      a: "Inhibitor has structural similarity to substrate.",
      b: "Km is decreased.",
      c: "Vmax is decreased.",
      d: "Reaction rate is independent of substrate concentration."
    },
    correctAnswer: "a",
    explanation: "A competitive inhibitor resembles the substrate structurally and competes for binding at the enzyme’s active site."
  },
  {
    question: "30. The optimum pH of most of the enzymes is:",
    answers: {
      a: "Between 2 and 4",
      b: "Between 5 and 9",
      c: "Between 8 and 12",
      d: "Above 12"
    },
    correctAnswer: "b",
    explanation: "Most enzymes function best at a pH close to physiological values, usually between 5 and 9."
  },
  {
    question: "31. Enzymes, which are produced in inactive form in the living cells, are called:",
    answers: {
      a: "Papain",
      b: "Lysozymes",
      c: "Apoenzymes",
      d: "Proenzymes"
    },
    correctAnswer: "d",
    explanation: "Proenzymes (also called zymogens) are inactive enzyme precursors that require activation to become functional."
  },
  {
    question: "32. Activation or inactivation of certain enzymes is accomplished by covalent modification of the amino acid:",
    answers: {
      a: "Hydroxy lysine",
      b: "Phenylalanine",
      c: "Lysine",
      d: "Serine"
    },
    correctAnswer: "d",
    explanation: "Covalent modification often involves phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of serine residues to regulate enzyme activity."
  },
  {
    question: "33. These enzymes have different structure but the same catalytic function. Frequently they are oligomers made from different polypeptide chains. These enzymes are called:",
    answers: {
      a: "Allosteric enzymes",
      b: "Isozymes",
      c: "Proenzymes",
      d: "Zymogens"
    },
    correctAnswer: "b",
    explanation: "Isozymes are distinct molecular forms of the same enzyme that catalyze the same reaction but differ in structure or kinetics."
  },
  {
    question: "34. In competitive enzyme activity inhibition, the inhibitor:",
    answers: {
      a: "Increases Vmax",
      b: "Decreases Vmax",
      c: "Does not affect Vmax",
      d: "Decreases Vmax and Km"
    },
    correctAnswer: "c",
    explanation: "Competitive inhibitors increase Km (require more substrate) but do not affect Vmax since inhibition can be overcome at high substrate concentrations."
  },
  {
    question: "35. Which of these enzymes is increased in myocardial infarction?",
    answers: {
      a: "Alkaline phosphatase",
      b: "Glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase",
      c: "Acid phosphatase",
      d: "Creatine kinase (CK-MB)"
    },
    correctAnswer: "d",
    explanation: "Creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) is specific to cardiac muscle and rises in blood after myocardial infarction."
  },
  {
    question: "36. As regards isoenzymes, which of the following is incorrect:",
    answers: {
      a: "They have similar polypeptide chains.",
      b: "They have different affinity to the substrate.",
      c: "They can be separated by electrophoresis.",
      d: "They catalyze the same reaction."
    },
    correctAnswer: "a",
    explanation: "Isoenzymes differ in their polypeptide composition, so it is incorrect to say they have similar chains."
  },
  {
    question: "37. Which statement is incorrect regarding feedback inhibition:",
    answers: {
      a: "Inhibition is usually allosteric.",
      b: "The final end product inhibits an enzyme catalyzing an early step of the metabolic pathway.",
      c: "It prevents the accumulation of unnecessary excessive products.",
      d: "It is a type of competitive inhibition."
      },
    correctAnswer: "d",
    explanation: "Feedback inhibition typically involves allosteric inhibition, not competitive inhibition, and helps regulate metabolic pathways."
  },
  {
    question: "38. Allosteric inhibition of an enzyme involves which of the following?",
    answers: {
      a: "Binding of an inhibitor to a site other than the substrate binding site.",
      b: "Binding of an inhibitor competitively to the substrate binding site.",
      c: "Binding of an inhibitor noncompetitively to the substrate binding site.",
      d: "Allosteric inhibitors increase the affinity of the enzyme to its substrate."
    },
    correctAnswer: "a",
    explanation: "Allosteric inhibitors bind to a separate regulatory site, causing conformational changes that reduce enzyme activity."
